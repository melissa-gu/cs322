// NOTE: A segment has same coordinates as intersection the segment aims at.
//   Throughout the rest of the semester, make sure that
//   intersections of a grid are processed in exactly the following order:
//     row 1 intersections, from left to right
//     row 2 intersections, from left to right, etc, for all rows.
//   In an actual simulation, that process should be repeated (in that specific
//   order) as many times as necessary for the desired length of the simulation.
//   But, for simplicity, the initial tester software students build should
//   only show the first iteration of the above process, that is, only one
//   processing of each of the intersections.
//
//   The format of the data to be used with the program in this file
//   is shown, via an example, at the end of this file.
