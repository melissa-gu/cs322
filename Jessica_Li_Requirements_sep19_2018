Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
   ... (one paragraph description of why the specific software is important, 
   and how client plans to use the software)
   
   Nowadays security has become really important for all aspect of our life. 
   The client wants a future traffic system that full of autonomous cars
   that focuses on security and speed. 
   After reading an article on wired magazine, the client realized that people
   can hack into driving cars and disable the air bags, the anti-lock brakes,
   or even the engine. Security is a huge problem with every system in the 
   world today, so the client does not want people to hack into the cars in the
   city and change their behaviors. The client wants this city traffic system 
   to be completely secure, meaning the car is not connected to the Internet 
   and no communication between the outside and the car is allowed. The client
   plans to use this system in the future with virtual reality goggles for the
   user of the car to see the whole system.
   
2. Description of Software
   ... (one paragraph description of the purpose of this software)

   The purpose of this software is to test the efficiency and security of
   a future city traffic system. The software serves as a simulation that 
   evaluates the average time it takes a car to go through a city full 
   of other moving autonomous cars. This simulation also takes the number
   of cars in the simulation as a input and calculates the amount of
   cars for the city to have a grid lock. This simulation is also designed
   to see what is the best algorithm for cars to take the minimum of 
   time to get through the city.

3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the 
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of up to 20 north-south two-way streets 
             and 20 east-west two-way streets.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices
             ... (subdivide 4.2.1 into as many rules as you think necessary)
             If the cars are going into direction where there are contention,
             The car going straight has priority over the car turning right.
             The car turning right has priority over the car turning left.
             If there are contention, the car with lower priority has to wait
             for the intersection to be cleared before it can proceed. 
             If more than one car have the same priority and are at the 
             intersection at the same time, the car that is generated earlier 
             will have priority.

       4.2.2 Stop signs at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.3 Traffic lights at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.4 Sensors at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.5 Implicit control devices at entrance to city section
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       ...

   4.3 Traffic flow 
       4.3.1 Speed of traffic
             4.3.1.1 All cars travel at the same speed.
             That speed is given by timeToTraverseSegment.
       4.3.2 Patterns of traffic flow
             (don't try to do at all before the deadline on Fri Sep 21; 
             eventually don't say something vague like "six or seven traffic 
             patterns will define the traffic flow", instead describe -- 
             using *separate* outline numbering for each such pattern
             -- all the traffic flow patterns that exist in the simulation and 
             thus are available to the user; you need not mention the various
             specific places where a car could actually make a turn)
        etc.
   4.4 Stochastic properties
       (describe the role of random numbers in the simulation)
   ...
   4.?? Additional assumptions
5. Input/Output
   (specific description of input and output formats and how the
   client will provide input and receive output; client has already indicated 
   whether he wants a graphical view and/or GUI input and output to the overall 
   software.)
6. Life Cycle Considerations
   6.1 Subsets
       6.1.1 (describe the first deliverable)
       6.1.2 (describe the second deliverable)
       ...
       6.1.5 (describe the deliverable on Wed, October 31, 2016)
   6.2 Possible extensions
       (number and list the ways the software can be extended after Oct 31, in 
       view of the client's longer-term needs)
   ...

7. Glossary
   7.1 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.2 A "section" is the portion of a street between two adjacent 
       intersections. The length of the section is a variable that can
       be changed.
   7.3 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
       directions from each other. They have no contention between the two
       segments and is either NW or SE.
   7.4 A "segment" is the portion of a section going in a single direction.
       There are two segments in one section. 
   7.5 An "intersection" is the where two sections meet.
       There are four directions at one intersection.
   7.6 A "grid lock" means the city has too many cars for it to function
       properly
   7.7 "Get through the city" means entering at one point on the boundary of
       the grid and exiting at the other boundary
   7.8 "Generated earlier" means that the car entered the city grid earlier
       than the other car.
 
8. Names of values.  (Below is at least a partial chart you can use.)

  averageTime             the average time for a car to go through the city
  maxNumOfCars            the maximum number of cars in this whole simulation
  timeGenerated           the time that the car entered the city

9. Questions to ask client.
   Can the intersection know things other than which direction the cars are 
   going, for example the time that the cars entered the city?
