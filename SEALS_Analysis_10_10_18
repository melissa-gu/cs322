Description of the simulation (from section 2 of Requirements for 10_10_18:
This software will simulate autonomous cars as they travel through a city
represented as a grid of intersecting streets. The software will not include a
GUI or virtual reality goggles, because the time and monetary cost needed to
implement would not be feasible. The software will take input that specifies
simulation parameters: the size of the grid of streets and approximate rate of
entry and location of entry and exit of each car. This input will be given
either through the command line or a file. The software will generate new cars
as the simulation proceeds, and output the average amount of time a car takes to
exit the city.
