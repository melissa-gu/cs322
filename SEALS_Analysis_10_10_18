            - has 15 time steps (more than one event can happen simultaneously
            - cars need not enter at the grid boundary; the scenario could
              occur (so to speak) in the middle of an entire simulation.
              1. Three cars are approaching the intersection, car1 is approaching
                 from the South, car2 is approaching from the West and car3 is
                 approaching from the East. Each car indicates their turn signal,
                 and all three cars are planning to make a left turn.
              2. No cars are in slots exiting the intersection, so car1 begins its
                 turn by moving one slot forward into the intersection in the
                 North direction.
              3. Car1 continues its turn and moves one slot forward in the North
                 direction.
              4. Car1 moves one slot in the West direction.
              5. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, exiting the
                 intersection.
              6. Car3 begins making its turn, first moving into the intersection
                 in the West direction.

                 moves one slot forward in the West direction.
              8. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, and car3
                 moves one slot to it's left in the South direction.
              9. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, and car3
                  exits the intersection and moves one slot forward in the South
                  direction.
              10. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                  one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 enters the
                  first slot in the intersection toward the West.
              11. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                  one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                  forward toward West.

                  one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                  to the left heading North.
              13. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                  one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                  forward heading north and exiting the intersection.
              14. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                  one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                  forward in the North direction.

--- BEGIN Third normal scenario (all in English, no diagram) that
            - involves three different cars and two intersections 
            - has 15 time steps (more than one event can happen simultaneously
            - cars need not enter at the grid boundary; the scenario could
              occur (so to speak) in the middle of an entire simulation.
            - each segment contains 10 slots.
            - State of the simulation before any car moves:
               Three cars 1, 2, 3 are approaching the same intersection. Car 1
               is on the NS segment, occupying the slot adjacent to the
               intersection and wants to turn left. Car 2 is on the WE segment,
               is occupying the slot adjacent to the intersection and wants to
               go straight. Car 3 is on the SN segment, also occupying the slot
               adjacent to the intersection, and wants to turn right. 
            1. Because Car 2 wants to go straight, Car 2 receives priority,
               and moves one more step to the intersection slot where the NS
               segment meets the WE segment. Car 1 and Car 3 do not move during
               this time step.
            2. Car 2, still going straight, moves one more step forward to the
               intersection slot where the SN segment meets the WE segment.
               Car 1 and Car 3 do not move during this time step.
            3. Car 2 is exiting the intersection and moves to the slot
               adjacent to the intersection on the segment WE, aiming away from
               the intersection (further in the E direction than the
               intersection). Car 1 and Car 3 do not move during this time step.
            4. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction,
               to the second slot of the WE segment. Car 3, which wants to turn
               right, now moves one step forward in the N direction to occupy
               the intersection slot where the WE and SN segments meet. Car 1,
               which wants to turn left, receives less priority and does not
               move in this timestep.
            5. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction,
               to the third slot of the WE segment. Car 3 is exiting the
               intersection and moves to the slot adjacent to the intersection
               on the segment WE, aiming away from the intersection (further in
               the E direction than the intersection). Car 1 still does not
               move in this timestep.
            6. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
               fourth slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
               further in the E direction, to the second slot of the WE segment.
               Car 1 moves forward in the S direction, to occupy the
               intersection slot where the EW and NS segments meet.
            7. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
               fifth slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
               further in the E direction, to the third slot of the WE segment.
               Car 1 moves forward in the S direction, to occupy the
               intersection slot where the WE and NS segments meet.
            8. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
               sixth slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
               further in the E direction, to the fourth slot of the WE segment.
               Car 1 moves forward in the E direction, to occupy the
               intersection slot where the WE and SN segments meet.
            9. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
               seventh slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
               further in the E direction, to the fifth slot of the WE segment.
               Car 1 is exiting the intersection and moves to the
               slot adjacent to the intersection on the segment WE, aiming away
               from the intersection (further in the E direction than the
               intersection).
            10. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
                eigth slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
                further in the E direction, to the sixth slot of the WE segment.
                Car 1 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
                second slot of the WE segment.
            11. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
                ninth slot of the WE segment. Car 3 moves one slot forward
                further in the E direction, to the seventh slot of the WE
                segment. Car 1 moves one slot forward further in the E
                direction, to the third lot of the WE segment.
            12. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
                tenth slot of the WE segment and is approaching the second
                intersection. Car 3 moves one slot forward further in the E
                direction, to the eighth slot of the WE segment. Car 1 moves one
                slot forward further in the E direction, to the fourth lot of
                the WE segment.
            13. Car 2 wants to move straight, so it moves one slot forward
                further in the E direction, to occupy the intersection slot
                where the NS and WE segments meet. Car 3 moves one slot
                forward further in the E direction, to the ninth slot of the
                WE segment. Car 1 moves one slot forward further in the E
                direction, to the fifth slot of the WE segment.
            14. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to
                occupy the intersection slot where the SN and WE segments meet.
                Car 3 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, to the
                tenth slot of the WE segment and is now approaching the second
                intersection. Car 1 moves one slot forward further in the E
                direction, to the sixth slot of the WE segment.
            15. Car 2 moves one slot forward further in the E direction, is
                exiting the second intersection and moves to the slot adjacent
                to the second intersection on the segment WE, aiming away from
                the second intersection (further in the E direction). Car 3
                wants to turn right, so it first moves one slot forward further
                in the E direction, to occupy the intersection slot where
                NS and WE segments meet. Car 1 moves one slot forward further
                in the E direction, to the seventh slot of the WE segment.

--- BEGIN Noun Extraction
Description of the simulation (from section 2 of Requirements for 10_10_18:
This software will simulate autonomous cars as they travel through a city
represented as a grid of intersecting streets. The software will not include a
GUI or virtual reality goggles, because the time and monetary cost needed to
implement would not be feasible. The software will take input that specifies
simulation parameters: the size of the grid of streets and approximate rate of
entry and location of entry and exit of each car. This input will be given
either through the command line or a file. The software will generate new cars
as the simulation proceeds, and output the average amount of time a car takes to
exit the city.
