--- BEGIN First normal scenario (all in English, no diagram) that
            - involves three different cars at a single intersection
            - has 15 time steps (more than one event can happen simultaneously
            - cars need not enter at the grid boundary; the scenario could
              occur (so to speak) in the middle of an entire simulation.
              
            Assume the number of segment user input is 10. Car 1 is going
            towards N and is at the slot three slots away from the intersection. 
            Car 2 is going towards W and is at the slot three slots away from 
            the intersection. Car 3 is going towards S and is at the slot five 
            slots away from the intersection.
            1. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
               W. Car 3 travels one slot towards S.
            2. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 1 is at the slot adjacent 
               to the intersection. Car 1 signals to go straight. Car 2 travels 
               one slot towards W. Car 2 is at the slot adjacent to the 
               intersection. Car 2 signals to turn left. Car 3 travels one slot 
               towards S.
            3. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 1 is in the intersection. 
               Car 2 waits at the slot adjacent to the intersection. Car 3 
               travels one slot towards S. 
            4. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 1 is in the intersection. 
               Car 2 waits at the slot adjacent to the intersection. Car 3 
               travels one slot towards S. Car 3 is at the slot adjacent to the 
               intersection and signals to turn left.
            5. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 1 is exiting the 
               intersection. Car 2 waits at the slot adjacent to the 
               intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards S in the 
               intersection.
            6. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 waits at the slot 
               adjacent to the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards S 
               in the intersection.
            7. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 waits at the slot 
               adjacent to the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards E 
               in the intersection. 
            8. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
               W in the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards E and is 
               exiting the intersection.
            9. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
               W in the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
            10. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S in the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
            11. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S and is exiting the intersection. Car 3 travels one slot 
                towards E.
            12. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
            13. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
            14. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
            15. Car 1 travels one slot towards N. Car 2 travels one slot towards 
                S. Car 3 travels one slot towards E.
