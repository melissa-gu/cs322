The class name: Setup
Responsibility:
1. Read user input from a file or the command-line
2. Construct an instance of simulation based on the input
3. Run the simulation
Collaboration:
1. Simulation Class

The class name: Simulation
Responsibility:
1. Initialize instance of grid class with number of streets based on constructor
   parameters
2. Send message to instance of grid to update positions of cars
3. Calculate and output the average time cars take to enter and exit the grid
   based on the messages received from grid instance
Collaboration:
1. Grid Class

The class name: Grid
Responsibility:
1. Initialize 2D array of slots
2. Initialize instance of traffic controller class
3. Initialize all instances of intersection and pass to traffic controller 
   instance
4. Send messages to slots to update the positions of cars
5. Send message to simulation instance based on average time in the grid for 
   cars
Collaboration:
1. Slot Class
2. Intersection Class
3. TrafficController Class

The class name: TrafficController
Responsibility:
1. Contains list of intersection instances
2. Receive messages from intersections containing information about which slots
   are occupied and references to the cars occupying these slots
3. Receive messages from cars approaching the intersection about the direction
   the car intends to proceed through the intersection
3. Determine which cars approaching intersections can move
4. Send messages to cars approaching intersections about whether they can move
Collaboration:
1. Intersection Class
2. Car Class

The class name: Car
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from traffic controller instance indicating whether this
   instance of car can move into intersection
2. Send message to traffic controller instance that this instance of car has 
   exited the grid and that contains information about the time this car took to 
   enter and exit
Collaboration:
1. Slot Class
2. TrafficController Class

The class name: Intersection
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from instances of slots making up this intersection with 
   references to cars within such slots
2. Send message to traffic controller instance with references to the cars
   occupying this instance of intersection and the adjacent slots
Collaboration:
1. TrafficController Class
2. Slot Class

The class name: Slot
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from grid instance about whether the car occupying this 
   instance of slot should be updated
2. Send message to car instance when it should move to a new slot
3. For slots that are part of an instance of intersection, the slot will send a 
   message containing a reference to the car occupying that slot to the 
   intersection if there is a Car occupying that slot
Collaboration:
1. Car Class
2. Intersection Class
