Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
   Self-Driving cars are quickly becoming more proficient. Some predict that in 
   the coming years self-driving cars will be common, transforming how people 
   travel. It's important for research to determine both the efficiency and the 
   safety of autonomous cars. Hackers have found ways to control cars from 
   outside of a car by sending it signals. One possible solution is to program 
   the cars to use visual cues from other cars and to eliminate the need for 
   wireless communication, preventing such hacking. 
2. Description of Software
   This software will simulate autonomous cars as they travel through a city 
   represented as a grid of intersecting streets. The software will not include 
   a GUI or virtual reality goggles, as the time and monetary cost needed to 
   implement would not be feasible. The software will take in input that 
   specifies simulation parameters: the size of the grid of streets and 
   approximate rate of entry and location of entry and exit of each car. This 
   input will be given either through the command line or a file. The software 
   will generate new cars as the simulation proceeds, and output the average 
   amount of time a car takes to exit the city. 

3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the 
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of up to 20 north-south two-way streets 
             and east-west two-way streets. The number of streets of each 
             direction is determined by input to the program.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices
             4.2.1.1 No car can occupy the same slot as any other car.
             4.2.1.2 If cars approaching the intersection have paths that will
                     intersect in the intersection, priority for the order of 
                     entering the intersection is given in the following order:
                     - Cars proceeding straight
                     - Cars turning right
                     - Cars turning left
                     4.2.1.2.1 If such cars with intersecting paths have the 
                               same priority according to the above rules, 
                               priority is given in the following order:
                               - Cars coming from S
                               - Cars coming from E
                               - Cars coming from N
                               - Cars coming from W
             4.2.1.3 Any car in the intersection has priority over cars that 
                     have not yet entered the intersection.
             4.2.1.4 A car (A) must wait for any other car (B), exiting in the 
                     direction through which A intends to exit, to fully exit 
                     the intersection and exit the slot right outside the 
                     intersection before A will proceed. 
             4.2.1.5 In certain conditions, cars will have paths that don't 
                     intersect, and will proceed through intersection
                     simultaneously. These conditions are generally specified 
                     as follows:
                     4.2.1.5.1 Cars are approaching from opposite directions 
                               and:
                               - Both cars are proceeding straight
                               - Both cars are turning right
                               - One car is proceeding straight, and one car is
                                 turning right
                     4.2.1.5.2 Cars are approaching perpendicular to one another 
                               and:
                               - Both cars are turning right
                               or: 
                               4.2.1.5.2.1 One car is coming from N, and one car 
                                           is coming from E and:
                                           - The car from E is turning right
                                             and the car from N is proceeding 
                                             straight
                                           - The car from E is turning right
                                             and the car from N is turning 
                                             left

                                           is coming from W and:
                                           - The car from N is turning right
                                             and the car from W is proceeding 
                                             straight

                                           is coming from E and:
                                           - The car from S is turning right
                                             and the car from E is proceeding 
                                             straight
                                           - The car from S is turning right
                                             and the car from E is turning 
                                             left
                               4.2.1.5.2.4 One car is coming from S, and one car 
                                           is coming from W and: 
                                           - The car from W is turning right
                                             and the car from S is proceeding 
                                             straight
                                           - The car from W is turning right
                                             and the car from S is turning
                                             left                               

                     4.2.1.5.3 Three cars are approaching the intersection and:

                               4.2.1.5.3.1 One car is coming from N, and two 
                                           cars are coming from S and E and:

                                             right
                               4.2.1.5.3.2 One car is coming from S, and two 
                                           cars are coming from N and W and:

                               4.2.1.5.3.3 One car is coming from E, and two 
                                           cars are coming from W and S and:
                                           - The car from E is proceeding
                                             straight

             4.2.1.6 Cars approaching the intersection will use signals to 
                     indicate whether they want to proceed straight, turn right,
                     or turn left. These signals will not be visible to the
                     user.
                     4.2.1.6.1 Cars approaching the intersection will be able to 
                               access the signals of other cars that are either
                               already in the intersection or are also 
                               approaching the intersection. This allows cars
                               to determine whether there is contention for
                               a slot in their intended path.

7. Glossary
   7.1 A "simulation" is a model or imitation of a real world process or 
       environment.
   7.2 A "GUI", or a graphic user interface, is a display that allows the user 
       to view graphical icons and visual indicators rather than just text.    
   7.3 An "average" time in this program refers to the mean time cars take to 
       cross through the entire simulated city. This average is calculated 
       by summing up the times each car takes to enter and exit the simulated 
       city and dividing that quantity by the total number of cars that have 
       fully exited the simulated city. If no cars have fully exited the city,
       the program will display a message that no cars have exited the city yet.
   7.4 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.5 A "section" is the area of a street between two adjacent 
       intersections.  
   7.6 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
       directions from each other.
   7.7 A "segment" is the part of a section going in a single direction.
   7.8 An "intersection" is where N/S and E/W facing roads intersect, and 
       the segments end. An intersection is composed of four slots. 
   7.9 A car that is "approaching the intersection" is a car that is in the 
       slot of road directly before the intersection.
   7.10 The "command line" is an all text display mode on a computer monitor
        that allows the user to enter commands and data.
   7.11 A "slot" refers to a portion of real estate that makes up a segment, or    
        one of the four portions of an intersection. Only one car can occupy a 
        slot at a time, and one car can only occupy one slot.
   7.12 Cars that are traveling in "opposite" directions are approaching the
        intersection according to exactly one of these:
        7.12.1 One car is coming from N, and one car is coming from S.
        7.12.2 One car is coming from E, and one car is coming from W.
   7.13 Cars that are approaching "perpendicular" to one another are approaching
        the intersection according to exactly one of these:
        7.13.1 One car is coming from N, and one car is coming from E.
        7.13.2 One car is coming from N, and one car is coming from W.
        7.13.3 One car is coming from S, and one car is coming from E.
        7.13.4 One car is coming from S, and one car is coming from W.
