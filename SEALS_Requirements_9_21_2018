Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
   Self-Driving cars are quickly becoming more common and more proficient. Some 
   predict that in the coming years self-driving cars will be everywhere 
   transforming how people travel.  It's important that research is done to 
   determine both the efficiency and the safety of autonomous vehicles. Hackers 
   have found ways to control vehicles from outside of the car by sending it 
   signals. One possible solution is to program the cars to use visual cues from 
   other cars and to eliminate the need for wireless communication and safeguard 
   against such hacking. This piece of software will strive to model the 
   efficiency and behavior of such vehicles according to the regulations listed 
   below.
2. Description of Software
   This purpose of this software is to develop a simulation of autonomous 
   vehicles as they travel through a city, where the city is represented as a 
   grid of intersecting streets. The software will display the simulation 
   visually to the user, through a GUI. The software will not include virtual 
   reality goggles, as the time and monetary cost needed to implement such a
   feature would not be feasible. The software will have the option to take in 
   input that specifies how the simulation will be run (e.g. the size of the 
   city or the number of cars). This input will be given either through the 
   command line or a file. The software will continuously generate new cars as
   the simulation proceeds, and output the average amount of time it took a 
   car to enter and exit the city.

3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the 
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of north-south two-way streets and 
             east-west two-way streets. The number of streets of each direction
             is determined by input to the program.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices
             4.2.1.1 Cars cannot occupy the same segments as any other car.
             4.2.1.2 If cars approaching the intersection have paths that will
                     intersect in the intersection, priority for the order of 
                     entering the intersection is given in the following order:
                     - Cars proceeding straight
                     - Cars turning right
                     - Cars turning left
                     4.2.1.1.1 If such cars with intersecting paths have the 
                               same priority according to the above rules, 
                               priority is given in the following order:
                               - Cars coming from S
                               - Cars coming from E
                               - Cars coming from N
                               - Cars coming from W
             4.2.1.3 Cars in the intersection have priority over cars that have
                     not yet entered the intersection.
             4.2.1.4 Cars following the path of another car must wait for the 
                     car they are following to fully exit the intersection and 
                     exit the spot right outside the intersection before 
                     proceeding.
             4.2.1.5 In certain conditions, cars will have paths that don't 
                     intersect, and can proceed through intersection
                     simultaneously. These conditions are generally specified 
                     as follows:
                     4.2.1.5.1 Cars are approaching from opposite directions 
                               and:
                               - Both cars are proceeding straight
                               - Both cars are turning right
                               - One car is proceeding straight, and one car is
                                 turning right
                     4.2.1.5.2 Cars are approaching perpendicular to one another 
                               (e.g. one car is coming from the north, one car 
                               is coming from the east) and:
                               - Both cars are turning
                               - The car from the east is turning right, and the 
                                 car from the north is proceeding straight
                                 (or the equivalent for whatever directions the
                                  cars are coming from)
                     4.2.1.5.3 Three cars are approaching the intersection and:
                               - All three cars are turning right
                     4.2.1.5.4 Four cars are approaching the intersection and:
                               - All four cars are turning right

             eventually don't say something vague like "six or seven traffic 
             patterns will define the traffic flow", instead describe -- 
             using *separate* outline numbering for each such pattern
             -- all the traffic flow patterns that exist in the simulation and 
             thus are available to the user; you need not mention the various
             specific places where a car could actually make a turn)

7. Glossary
   7.1 A "simulation" is a model or imitation of a real world process or 
       environment.
   7.2 A "GUI", or a graphic user interface, is a display that allows the user 
       to view graphical icons and visual indicators rather than just text.    
   7.3 An "average", which in this software is used in the context of the 
       average time it takes a car to cross through the entire simulated city,
       is calculated by summing up the values for the time for each car in the 
       simulation and dividing by the number of cars.
   7.4 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.5 A "section" is the portion of a street between two adjacent 
       intersections.  
   7.6 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
       directions from each other.
   7.7 A "segment" is the portion of a section going in a single direction.
       It can also refer to one of the four portions of the intersection.
   7.8 An "intersection" is where a N/S and an E/W facing road intersect.
   7.9 A car that is "approaching the intersection" is a car that is in the 
       section of road directly before the intersection.
   7.10 The "command line" is an all text display mode on a computer monitor
        that allows the user to enter commands and data.
