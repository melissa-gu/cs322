Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
   ... (one paragraph description of why the specific software is important, 
   and how client plans to use the software)
2. Description of Software
   ... (one paragraph description of the purpose of this software)
3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the 
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of up to 20 north-south two-way streets 
             and 20 east-west two-way streets.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices
             ... (subdivide 4.2.1 into as many rules as you think necessary)

       4.2.2 Stop signs at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.3 Traffic lights at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.4 Sensors at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.5 Implicit control devices at entrance to city section
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       ...
       4.4.??
   4.3 Traffic flow 
       4.3.1 Speed of traffic
             4.3.1.1 All cars travel at the same speed.
             That speed is given by timeToTraverseSegment.
       4.3.2 Patterns of traffic flow
             (don't try to do at all before the deadline on Fri Sep 21; 
             eventually don't say something vague like "six or seven traffic 
             patterns will define the traffic flow", instead describe -- 
             using *separate* outline numbering for each such pattern
             -- all the traffic flow patterns that exist in the simulation and 
             thus are available to the user; you need not mention the various
             specific places where a car could actually make a turn)
        etc.
   4.4 Stochastic properties
       (describe the role of random numbers in the simulation)
   ...
   4.?? Additional assumptions
5. Input/Output
   (specific description of input and output formats and how the
   client will provide input and receive output; client has already indicated 
   whether he wants a graphical view and/or GUI input and output to the overall 
   software.)
6. Life Cycle Considerations
   6.1 Subsets
       6.1.1 (describe the first deliverable)
       6.1.2 (describe the second deliverable)
       ...
       6.1.5 (describe the deliverable on Wed, October 31, 2016)
   6.2 Possible extensions
       (number and list the ways the software can be extended after Oct 31, in 
       view of the client's longer-term needs)
   ...
   6.??
7. Glossary
   7.1 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.2 A "section" is the portion of a street between two adjacent 
       intersections.  
   7.3 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
       directions from each other.
   7.4 A "segment" is the portion of a section going in a single direction.
   ... (clarify the above further, and insert additional terms into the
        glossary)

8. Names of values.  (Below is at least a partial chart you can use.)

  name of value           intended meaning
  ---------------------   -----------------------------------------------------
  timeToTraverseSegment   time in time-units for one car to traverse one segment
  maxSegmentCapacity      maximum num of cars in one segment 
  ...
