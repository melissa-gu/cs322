Traffic Flow Simulator: Requirements Document
1. Background
  1.1 Self-Driving cars are quickly becoming more common and more proficient.
      Some predict that in the coming years self-driving cars will be everywhere
      transforming how people travel.  It's important that research is done to
      determine both the efficiency and the safety of autonomous vehicles.
  1.2 Hackers have found ways to control vehicles from outside of the car by
      sending it signals, therefore they must be developed to use visual cues from
      the other cars and not communicate with each other.
  1.3 This piece of software will strive to test the efficiency and competency
      of these vehicles having no way to communicate.
  1.4 The goal is to evaluate the safety and efficiency of having the cars
      act given a strict set of regulations that will be listen below in the
      document
2. Description of Software
  2.1 This purpose of this software is to develop a simulation of autonomous
      vehicles as they travel through the city, without communication.
  2.2 The software will have different configurations in order to test different
      circumstances such as having more cars and randomized locations.
  2.3 There will be a way to manually generate each individual car.  This will
      be done using a configuration file.  Many of the values noted in section
      8 will be included.
  2.4 The simulation will demonstrate the movement of cars in and out of a city
      with 20 segments North to South and 20 segments East to West.
  2.5 It will create a document containing a description of everything that
      occurs during the simulation.
  2.6 After the simulation runs it will create a report demonstrating the
      results of the program, specifically the average time it took for a car
      to exit the city.
  2.7 The software will include a visual representation of the simulation as it
      is occurring.  Giving the client the ability to see it in action.
3. Environmental Characteristics
   (You need put nothing in this section at this time, but have such a
   section heading; the section might eventually describe such things as the
   operating system that could be used, the version of compilers used, etc.)
4. Simulation Characteristics
   4.1 Geographic layout
       4.1.1 The city section is a grid of up to 20 north-south two-way streets
             and 20 east-west two-way streets.
       etc.
   4.2 Traffic control devices
       4.2.1 Intersections controlled by rules rather than control devices
             ... (subdivide 4.2.1 into as many rules as you think necessary)

       4.2.2 Stop signs at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.3 Traffic lights at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.4 Sensors at intersections
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       4.2.5 Implicit control devices at entrance to city section
             (don't put anything in this section for now, but have its heading)
       ...
       4.4.??
   4.3 Traffic flow
       4.3.1 Speed of traffic
             4.3.1.1 All cars travel at the same speed.
             That speed is given by timeToTraverseSegment.
       4.3.2 Patterns of traffic flow
             (don't try to do at all before the deadline on Fri Sep 21;
             eventually don't say something vague like "six or seven traffic
             patterns will define the traffic flow", instead describe --
             using *separate* outline numbering for each such pattern
             -- all the traffic flow patterns that exist in the simulation and
             thus are available to the user; you need not mention the various
             specific places where a car could actually make a turn)
        etc.
   4.4 Stochastic properties
       (describe the role of random numbers in the simulation)
   ...
   4.?? Additional assumptions
5. Input/Output
   (specific description of input and output formats and how the
   client will provide input and receive output; client has already indicated
   whether he wants a graphical view and/or GUI input and output to the overall
   software.)
6. Life Cycle Considerations
   6.1 Subsets
       6.1.1 (describe the first deliverable)
       6.1.2 (describe the second deliverable)
       ...
       6.1.5 (describe the deliverable on Wed, October 31, 2016)
   6.2 Possible extensions
       (number and list the ways the software can be extended after Oct 31, in
       view of the client's longer-term needs)
   ...

7. Glossary
   7.1 A "direction" is exactly one of the following: N, W, S, E.
       Those letters abbreviate North, West, South, East, respectively.
   7.2 A "section" is the portion of a street between two adjacent
       intersections.
   7.3 Each section consists of exactly two segments that aim in opposite
       directions from each other.
   7.4 A "segment" is the portion of a section going in a single direction.

8. Names of values.  (Below is at least a partial chart you can use.)

  name of value           intended meaning
  ---------------------   -----------------------------------------------------
  timeToTraverseSegment   time in time-units for one car to traverse one segment
  maxSegmentCapacity      maximum num of cars in one segment
  carEnterancePoint       the spot at which the car will enter the city
  carExitPoint            the spot at which the car will leave the city
  averageExitTime         the average time that it takes for all cars to leave

9. Questions to ask client.
   9.1 Should the software contain configurations to the behavior of the cars in
       order to test which ones are more efficient?
   9.2
