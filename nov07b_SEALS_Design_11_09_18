The class name: SimulationView
Responsibility:
1. Read user input from a file or the command-line line by line and print 
   summary of inputted data in English
2. Construct an instance of Simulation based on the input
3. Run the Simulation
4. Receive and print message from Simulation class that contains the 
   average time cars that have exited the grid have taken to exit the grid.
Collaboration:
1. Simulation Class
Pseudocode:
setup.printSummary() {
  print(simulation.toString());
}

setup.printAverage() {
  print(simulation.getAverage());
}

The class name: Simulation
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from SimulationView instance to construct the instance of 
   Simulation class
2. Send message to Grid to initialize instance of Grid class with number of
   Intersections based on constructor parameters
3. Initialize a list of instances of Car class with the following variables for
   each car:
   3.1 Integer ID representing the instance of Car
   3.2 Integer representing the coordinate of the segment or instance of
       Intersection the car is in, with the initial value specified by user
       input
   3.3 Initialize integer representing time left in a segment,
       timeLeftInSegment, with the initial value of timeToTraverseSegment
   3.4 Initialize integer representing the direction (N,S,W,E) the instance of
       Car is aiming towards
   3.5 Initialize integer representing the number of blocks the car will travel
       before turning
   3.6 Initialize integer representing direction of turn
   3.7 Initialize string representing a summary of the car's status in each 
       simulated time-step. This string is initially empty, and remains 
       empty except in cases where the car moves to a new Intersection 
       instance or leaves the grid.
4. Send messages to newly initialized cars to enqueue themselves in queues of
   the Intersection instance corresponding to their intersection ID
5. Send messages to instances of Car to update positions of cars and decrement
   the cars' timeToTraverseSegments appropriately at each time-step
6. Send message to Grid instance to update the state of the Intersection
   instances at each time-step
7. Receives message from each instance of Car about whether that car has left
   the grid. If the car has left the grid, the car will be removed from the
   list of active cars and added to a list of cars that have left the grid, 
   and the numCarsExited variable is incremented. The Simulation also receives 
   a message containing the car's entry and exit time-steps, and uses them to 
   compute that car's time to exit the grid, and adds this to 
   sumOfAllCarTimesToExit. The Simulation sends a message to the Car instance to
   update that car's summary string.
8. Receive message from Grid instance at each time-step containing summary of 
   each Intersection instance.
9. Send message to SimulationView class that contains summary of entire 
   Simulation instance at each time-step.
10. At the end of the Simulation, send message to SimulationView class that 
    contains the average time cars that have exited the grid have taken to exit 
    the grid.

Pseudocode:
// updates the position of each car in the simulation
// sends message to grid to update itself
simulation.update() {
    grid.update();
    for all car in activeCars:
        car.update();
        // If car is exiting the grid
        if (car.hasLeftGrid()) {
            car.appendToSummary("car#" + car.ID + " has left the grid");
            activeCars.remove(car);
            exitedCars.add(car);
            numCarsExited++;
            timeToExit = car.getExitTime() - car.getEntryTime();
            sumOfAllCarTimesToExit += timeToExit;
        }
}

// returns summary of state of simulation, including intersections and cars,
// at each time-step
simulation.toString() {
  print(grid.toString());
}

// prints average time cars took to exit the grid
simulation.getAverage() {
 String result;
 result += "The average time cars took to exit the grid was ";

}

The class name: Grid
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from Simulation instance to construct the instance of Grid
   with information about the number of Intersection instances
2. Initialize 2D array of Intersection instances, sending message to each
   instance with an integer ID representing the Intersection
3. Initialize an instance of IntersectionController for each Intersection with
   an integer ID representing its corresponding Intersection instance
4. Receive message from Simulation instance to update the Intersection instances
   at each time-step by doing (4) below
5. Send message to each IntersectionController instance to update the state of
   its corresponding Intersection at each time-step
6. Receive message from each Intersection instance containing a string summary 
   of the segments and the cars occupying the segments
7. Send message to Simulation instance at each time-step containing summary of 
   each Intersection instance.

3. IntersectionController Class
Pseudocode:
// grid sends message to each traffic controller to update
grid.update() {
    for intersection_controller : intersection_controllers:
        intersection_controller.update();
}
// grid receives message from each instance of Intersection
grid.toString() {
  String summary;
  for (int i = 1; i <= grid.numRows; i++) {

The class name: Intersection
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from Grid instance with integer ID to construct instance of
   Intersection class
2. Initialize 2D integer array of size 4 representing the four slots within an
   intersection that could contain integer car IDs
3. Initialize four integer queues corresponding to four directions that could
   contain integer car IDs. Each queue represents list of Car instances
   occupying the segment that aims towards the Intersection instance
4. Receive message from Car instances about direction the Car will proceed
   through the Intersection instance
5. Receive message from IntersectionController instance at each time-step to
   update the state of the Intersection. This message could contain information
   about which Car instance(s) to dequeue (if such a Car instance exists) and
   how to update Car instances already in the 2D array.
6. Update the state of the Intersection in the following ways:
   6.1 Dequeue cars that can move into the Intersection instance according
       to the IntersectionController message
   6.2 Update the 2D array to reflect the movement of Car instances in the
       Intersection
   6.3 Send message to Car instances that have left the Intersection instance.
       This message should tell the car which Intersection instance the
       car is entering next, and also which direction the Car is traveling. If
       the car is no longer traveling towards an intersection, but is instead
       exiting the instance of Grid, the intersection ID for the next
       Intersection instance will be -1
7. Receive messages from Car instances about which queue to enqueue the Car
   into, and enqueue that Car instance
8. Sends message to Intersection Controller if an instance of Car can enter the
   queue for the next Intersection based on the direction of the Car's turn and
   the Car's current direction.
9. Receive message from Car instance at each time-step containing a String 
   summary of that car's status at that time-step (e.g. "car#4 is removed
   from SOUTHWARD queue of intersection [1,2] and placed into SOUTHWARD 
   queue of intersection [1,1]").
10. Send message to Grid instance at each time-step containing a String summary 
    of the segments and the cars occupying the segments of this Intersection

The class name: Car
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from Simulation instance containing information about car ID
   and other variables to construct instance of Car class
2. Receive message from Simulation instance at each time unit to decrement
   timeLeftInSegment value at each time unit
   2.1 When the car's intersection ID is equal to -1and the 
       timeLeftInSegment value is 0, the Car instance will send a message to the 
       Simulation class that the Car instance has left the Grid instance. The 
       Car instance will also receive a message from the Simulation class to the 
       car's summary to reflect that it has been removed from the Grid instance.
3. Upon initialization, receive message from Simulation instance to enqueue this
   instance of Car in a queue of the Intersection instance corresponding to
   the intersection ID
4. Upon exiting an Intersection instance, the instance of Car will a receive
   message from its current Intersection instance about which Intersection ID
   the car is entering next and the direction it is traveling. If
   the car is no longer traveling towards an intersection, but is instead
   exiting the instance of Grid, the intersection ID will be -1. The car
   will update its intersection ID, the variable representing its direction,
   potentially decrement the integer representing the number of blocks the car
   will travel before turning, and then do (5) below if the Intersection ID is
   not -1.
5. Send message to instance of Intersection corresponding to the car's
   intersection ID to enqueue the car in the correct queue based on the car's
   direction
6. Sends a message to Simulation about whether this instance of Car has
   exited the grid.
7. Send message to Intersection instance at each time-step containing a string 
   summary of that car's status at that time-step (e.g. "car#4 is removed
   from SOUTHWARD queue of intersection [1,2] and placed into SOUTHWARD 
   queue of intersection [1,1]")

Responsibility:
1. Receive message from Grid instance containing information about intersection
   ID to construct instance of IntersectionController class
2. Receive message from Grid instance at each time-step to update the
   Intersection instance corresponding to its Intersection ID
3. Receive message from Intersection instance containing information about which
   slots of the 2D array are occupied
4. Receive message from Intersection instance containing information about Car
   instances approaching the Intersection instance
5. Receive messages from Car instances about each Car's direction and whether
   the car is turning, and from this determine which segment/queue the Car will
   enter after exiting the Intersection instance
6. Determine which Car instance(s) approaching an Intersection instance can move
   into the instance based on the following:
   6.1 Receive message from the Intersection instance about whether the size of
       the queue to enqueue the Car into after exiting the Intersection instance 
       is less than maxSegmentCapacity.
   6.2 Rules specified in Requirements document
   6.3 Whether the values of timeLeftInSegment for each Car instance are zero
7. Send message at each time-step to corresponding Intersection instance that
   tells that instance to update its state. This message could contain
   information about which Car instance(s) to dequeue (if such a Car instance
   exists).
