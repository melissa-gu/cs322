            - involves three different cars at a single intersection
            - has 15 time steps (more than one event can happen simultaneously
            - cars need not enter at the grid boundary; the scenario could

            1. Three cars are approaching the intersection, car1 is approaching
               from the South, car2 is approaching from the West and car3 is
               approaching from the East. Each car indicates their turn signal,
               and all three cars are planning to make a left turn.
            3. No cars are in slots exiting the intersection, so car1 begins its
               turn by moving one slot forward into the intersection in the
               North direction.
            4. Car1 continues its turn and moves one slot forward in the North
               direction.
            5. Car1 moves one slot in the West direction.
            6. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, exiting the
               intersection.
            7. Car3 begins making its turn, first moving into the intersection
               in the West direction.
            8. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, and car3
               moves one slot forward in the West direction.
            9. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, and car3
               moves one slot to it's left in the South direction.
            10. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, and car3
                exits the intersection and moves one slot forward in the South
                direction.
            11. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 enters the
                first slot in the intersection toward the West.
            12. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                forward toward West.
            13. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                to the left heading North.
            14. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                forward heading north and exiting the intersection.
            15. Car1 moves one slot forward in the West direction, car3 moves
                one slot forward in the South direction, and car2 moves one slot
                forward in the North direction.

Description of the simulation (from section 2 of Requirements for 10_10_18:
This software will simulate autonomous cars as they travel through a city
represented as a grid of intersecting streets. The software will not include a
GUI or virtual reality goggles, because the time and monetary cost needed to
implement would not be feasible. The software will take input that specifies
simulation parameters: the size of the grid of streets and approximate rate of
entry and location of entry and exit of each car. This input will be given
either through the command line or a file. The software will generate new cars
as the simulation proceeds, and output the average amount of time a car takes to
exit the city.

List of all the nouns that appear in the above description:
- Software
- Autonomous cars
- City
- Grid of intersecting streets
- GUI
- Virtual reality goggles
- Time
- Monetary cost
- Input
- Simulation parameters
- Size of grid of streets
- Rate of entry

- Exit
- Location of entry
- Loation of exit
- Command line
- File
- Simulation
- Output
- Average amount of time car takes to exit city
