The class name: Setup
Responsibility:
1. Read user input from a file or the command-line
2. Construct an instance of Simulation based on the input
3. Run the Simulation
Collaboration:
1. Simulation Class

The class name: Simulation
Responsibility:
1. Send message to Grid to initialize instance of Grid class with number of 
   Intersections based on constructor parameters
2. Initialize a list of instances of Cars with the following variables for each
   Car:
   2.1 Integer ID representing the Car
   2.2 Integer representing the coordinate of the segment or intersection the 
       Car is in, with the initial value specified by user input
   2.3 Initialize integer representing time left in a segment, 
       timeLeftInSegment, with the intial value of timeToTraverseSegment
   2.4 Initialize integer representing the direction (N,S,W,E) the Car is
       aiming towards
3. Send message to instance of Cars to update positions of Cars and decrement
   the Cars' timeToTraverseSegments appropriately
4. Calculate and output the average time each instance of Car takes to enter and 
   exit the grid based on the messages received from grid instance
Collaboration:

2. Car Class
3. Setup Class

The class name: Grid
Responsibility:
1. Initialize 2D array of Intersection instances, sending message to each 
   instance with an integer ID representing the Intersection
2. Initialize an instance of TrafficController for each Intersection
3. For all Intersection instances, send message to TrafficController to update
   the state of each intersection
Collaboration:
1. Intersection Class
2. TrafficController Class

The class name: Intersection
Responsibility:
1. Initialize 2D integer array of size 4 representing the four slots within an 
   intersection that contains integer car IDs
2. Initialize four integer queues corresponding to four directions that contain 
   integer car IDs. Each queue represents list of Car instances occupying the
   segment that aims towards the intersection, with timeLeftInSegment values
   equal to zero
3. Receive message from Car instances about direction the Car will proceed
   through the Intersection instance
4. Receive message from TrafficController to dequeue cars that can move 
   into the Intersection instance
5. Update the 2D array to reflect the movement of Cars instances in the
   intersection
6. Receive messages from Car instances about which queue to enqueue the Car 
   into, and enqueue that Car if the queue's size has not reached
   maxSegmentCapacity
Collaboration:
1. TrafficController Class
2. Car Class

The class name: Car
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from simulation at each time unit to decrement 
   timeLeftInSegment value at each time unit
2. When timeLeftInSegment first becomes 0, send message to instance of 
   Intersection corresponding to the car's intersection ID to enqueue the car in 
   the correct queue based on the car's direction
Collaboration:
1. Simulation Class
2. Intersection Class

The class name: TrafficController
Responsibility:
1. Receive message from Intersection containing information about which 
   slots of the 2D array are occupied
2. Receive message from Intersection containing information about cars 
   approaching the intersection
3. Receive messages from Car instances about each Car's direction, and
   determines which segment the Car will enter after exiting the intersection
4. Determine which Car instance(s) approaching intersection can move into the
   intersection based on:
   4.1. Whether the size of the queue to enqueue the Car into after exiting the
        intersection is less than maxSegmentCapacity
   4.2. Rules specified in Requirements document
5. Send message to Intersection to dequeue Car instance(s) that can move into
   the Intersection and update the 2D array
Collaboration:
1. Intersection Class
2. Car Class
